# > PureStack_Audit_Protocol_v2.0

### Engineering Selection | Validated by Code

**PureStack is not a recruiting agency.** We are a Technical Validation Utility for the High-End market.
We filter out the noise by auditing engineers through asynchronous, real-world coding challenges. We guarantee that the talent presented is "Plug & Play".
