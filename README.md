# ⚡ PureStack Engineering Protocol v2.0

### 🛡️ Technical Validation Utility
**PureStack is not a recruiting agency.** We are a High-Performance Validation Protocol.
We filter out the noise by auditing engineers through asynchronous, real-world coding challenges. We guarantee that the talent presented is "Plug & Play".

> *"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."* — Linus Torvalds

### 🧬 The Automated Gatekeeper
Unlike standard take-home assignments, our repositories are equipped with a **CI/CD Quality Gate (`audit.yml`)**.
When you submit your Pull Request, our system will automatically scan for:
* ❌ **Anti-Patterns:** (e.g., `System.out.println`, `time.sleep`, `any` types).
* ❌ **Security Risks:** (e.g., Hardcoded credentials, SQL Injection vulnerabilities).
* ❌ **Architecture Violations:** (e.g., Spaghetti code, missing DTOs).

**If the Gatekeeper fails, your submission is rejected immediately.**
